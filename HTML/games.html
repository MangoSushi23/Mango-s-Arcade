        <img src="images/pacman.jpg">
        <p>Pac-Man, a classic arcade game created by Namco in 1980, stands as an enduring icon in the realm of video gaming. At its core, Pac-Man traverses a maze, gobbling up small little dots while dodging four colorful ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. These spectral adversaries each possess distinct behaviors, adding different layers of strategy to the game. Along the way, Pac-Man can consume power pellets to turn the tables on his pursuers, momentarily transforming them into edible prey. Bonus fruits sporadically appear, tempting players with extra points. As the game progresses, the mazes become increasingly more complicated, the ghosts becoming more relentless. Pac-Man's influence extends beyond gaming, permeating popular culture and inspiring countless adaptations and merchandise. Its simple yet addictive gameplay and cultural impact have solidified Pac-Man's place in history as a beloved and timeless classic.</p>
